	- Forgot to remove debug prints.


0.02    2017-01-28 (PERLANCAR)

        - Elide all parts that have the highest priority equally instead of
          eliding & eliminating parts one by one. E.g. elide("aaaaa<elspan
          prio=0>|</elspan>bbbbb", 9) now becomes "aa..|bb.." instead of
          "aaaaa|b..".

        - Support per-part marker.
